## Notes
1. My other project [Stock Market Search](https://github.com/nishantkakar/Stock-Website) has to be deployed on a web server for this app to work
2. The apiurl variable in `\app\src\main\java\com\reverselabs\samplestock\MainActivity.java` has to updated with the URL where the above project has been deployed
3. The URL currently in the MainActivity.java file may or may not work
